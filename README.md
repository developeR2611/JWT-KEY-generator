# 🔐 Security

This application prioritizes privacy and security.

* All secret keys are generated locally in your browser.
* No generated keys are sent to any server.
* No tracking of generated secrets.
* Uses the browser's Web Crypto API (`window.crypto.getRandomValues()`), ensuring cryptographically secure random values suitable for generating JWT signing secrets.
